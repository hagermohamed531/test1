# TicTacToe GameServer 
Welcome to the TicTacToe GameServer, a simple Java application allowing users to interact with our GameServer. The goal of this project is to make possible for users to have a richer experience when playing TicTacToe. Separating the Client from the Server side allows us to have a nicer separation of concerns and ease deployment of one part without having to deploy the other.
