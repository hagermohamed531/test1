# TicTacToe GameServer 
Welcome to the TicTacToe GameServer, a simple Java application allowing users to interact with our GameServer. The goal of this project is to make possible for users to have a richer experience when playing TicTacToe. Separating the Client from the Server side allows us to have a nicer separation of concerns and ease deployment of one part without having to deploy the other.
# Getting up and running
  Download the code, open it from your IDE.
  If you are using NetBeans IDE 8.2 you can follow this link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VGaFfkht6mgTYx83aW9iO4QkBtRY048d).                                              run the appliction, now you can start the server.
  the server is waiting the Gameclient to run .                                                                                                                                       Download Game Client from this link (https://github.com/ahmedKhaled1995/tic_tak_toe_client_ui_final)
